# hello-world

Hello uhhh people.

My anme is Ike and I suck at coding and do not know anything about being a developer or about using github. I am here today to tackle my fears and dive into the world of development so that I can pair that with my sub-par security skills and eveutually be decent enough at this abstract field called "security" to secure a six figure paying job. That job is not permananet it is only to fund my entrepreneur goals and other hobbies in life.
